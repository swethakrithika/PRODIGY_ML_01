Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathroom
Overview:
This project involves implementing a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and contains relevant information about housing features and prices.

Dataset:
The dataset can be accessed on Kaggle:"https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data"

Model Used:
For this project, a linear regression model is employed to predict house prices. Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that establishes a relationship between independent variables (square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms) and the dependent variable (house prices) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.
